When finalized, the rule would allow hearing aids within this category to be sold directly to consumers in stores or online without a medical exam or a fitting by an audiologist. You can read more about it here. You know how important it is for people to get their hearing tested, particularly once they are over the age of 55. But aFebruary 2020 studyof 2,000 UK adults found that those over the age of 55 believed they should have their hearing checked every three years, yet the average amount of time since they last had their hearing tested was nine years. The reality—based on recommendations from audiologists and hearing professionals—is that adults over the age of 55 should have their hearing tested every year. In fact, the British and Irish Hearing Instrument Manufacturers Association (BIHIMA) is calling for mandatory annual hearing tests for adults aged 55+. While regular hearing tests are important at all ages, they become even more important as people age. Age-related hearing loss is one of the most common conditions affecting older adults. Approximately one in three people in the United States between the ages of 65 and 74 has hearing loss, andnearly half of adults over the age of 75 have difficulty hearing. This means that as people approach the age where hearing loss commonly occurs, it is essential to have their hearing regularly tested so they can receive the treatment they need. Some professionals believe that even 55 is too late to start annual hearing testing. Almost 30% of British and Irish audiologists surveyed by BIHIMA inDecember 2020 said that they recommended adults begin annual hearing tests before the age of 55. Regular hearing tests are important because your hearing affects your daily life—including personal relationships, social life, career, and simple joys of life like listening to music or the sounds of nature. In addition, untreated hearing loss has been linked to a greater risk of other serious conditions, includingdepression, social isolation and loneliness, anxiety, falls, anddementia Based on the studies and work done by the British and Irish Hearing Instrument Manufacturers Association, annual hearing tests over the age of 55 might become mandatory soon in the United Kingdom. Although it doesn’t look like annual hearing tests will become mandatory in the United States in the immediate future, it does show that hearing loss is becoming a more recognized health concern.

C O M P A G E - 0 5 Digital Marketing Did you know? 3 Keys to aSuccessful Online Practice in 2022 2022 is right around the corner! And you really should be preparing right now for the new year. There are so many big things coming for hearing professionals that you may feel overwhelmed by the potential changes. But here at AudiologyPlus, we are prepared to help you sift through the news and plan for your business needs. Here are 3 big things to be aware of and start working on now as you plan for your business in 2022: This can be boosted with online marketing tactics like pay-per-click (PPC) ads and other online efforts that work to target your ideal audience. Content marketing and a mobile-first experience are also key. Basically, you want to make it easy for a potential new patient to choose you and stay with you. Make your website and entire online presence appealing and professional and offer valuable information to your patients even before they come to your office. The United States is inching closer and closer tofinally releasing over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aidsto the general public. You may have mixed (or negative) feelings about this development. However, regardless of your personal or professional opinion on over-the-counter hearing aids, this is a great opportunity for your business. If you think back to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, e-commerce was the be-all, end-all. Enabling customers to make their purchases online—without risking their health by going to a store or office in person—was a huge boon to businesses prepared with e-commerce options. Although the COVID pandemic may be waning (hopefully!), e-commerce will never become obsolete. In fact, business analysts are projecting that e-commerce will only continue to grow in importance. The key to succeeding in business—both online and offline—is to show your patients how you are different from (and better than) your competitors. Brand differentiation will be crucial in 2022. As a practice owner, you should start to ask yourself what makes you different in such a competitive market. It is time to start planning to offer OTC hearing aids. As a hearing professional, you should plan to incorporate OTCs into your practice and start addressing this topic online—on your website and elsewhere online, like on your social media pages. Helpful assets like FAQs and informational videos are very helpful to the patient audience. Plus, you are a professional who is making yourself available to the OTC audience. This can only grow your practice. If you want to make life easy for your patients (especially with over-the-counter hearing aids coming soon), e-commerce is a necessity. The accessibility and convenience of e-commerce for your patients will only boost their loyalty to you as a local practice. Consider the following questions: Why should someone see you versus just buying a device from a huge retailer? What can you offer in-house that goes above and beyond? What do you provide that your local competitors do not? Reassess your goals andmessaging tomake sure your practice does not go unnoticed. 1. Over-the-Counter HearingAids 2. e-Commerce Is Key 3.

C O M 3 Things to Focus onWhen It Comes to SEO in 2022 If you have been marketing your business online for several years now, you have seen many changes in SEO (search engine optimization). If you rewind the clock 10-15 years, the best practice was to optimize a page for a single keyword by simply using that keyword as frequently as possible—even at the risk of making your writing sound odd. Today, SEO strategies are much more advanced, and so are search engines. Looking toward 2022 and the years ahead, here are a few things to focus on when it comes to digital marketing: By following these tips, you can get your online presence off to a strong start in 2022. In recent years, local SEO results have become very important. The “local pack” has become a coveted spot for Google search engine results, and searchers know they can search for businesses and services “near me.” So, when someone searches for an “audiologist near me” or “audiologist in [my city],” you want to appear in the top results. Again, we have come a long way from the days of “keyword stuffing.” The aim is no longer to repeat a keyword as often as possible and hope that page would come up when people searched for that keyword online. Now, the goal is to answer the question asked by the searcher. As noted above, the key is to give the searcher what they are looking for. You need to consider who your searchers are (your audience), what they are looking for or asking about, and how you can deliver what they are looking for on your website. As we head into 2022 and beyond, it will become increasingly important to hone in on searcher intent and provide the best answer to their queries. To do well in online search result rankings, you need to provide the best, most relevant answer to the question a searcher asks. You can do this by providing quality content that offers valuable information and seeks to truly provide the answer the searcher needs. Google has been investing heavily in machine learning and artificial intelligence to ensure that their search results answer the question the searcher poses. If you want to do well in online searches in 2022 andmoving forward, make sure you are answering the important questions. If you are not sure where to start, create a list of questions you are frequently asked about your services, products, and qualifications. Answer these questions on your website. Demonstrate that you are an expert in your field. Search engines like Google are expected to continue to place great emphasis on local results. Now, a local search brings up a Google Map with mapped search results, reviews, photos, and more. Customers rely on these types of results to help them find what they are looking for nearby, and that is not going to change. To take advantage of what these potential new patients are looking for, you should focus on your local online presence. 1. Local Focus 2. Answer theQuestion 3. Seek Searcher Intent","@ID":6}]}}
