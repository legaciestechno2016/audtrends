 P A G E - 0 6 A U D I O L O G Y P L U S . C O M 3 Things to Focus on When It Comes to SEO in 2022 If you have been marketing your business online for several years now, you have seen many changes in SEO (search engine optimization). If you rewind the clock 10-15 years, the best practice was to optimize a page for a single keyword by simply using that keyword as frequently as possible—even at the risk of making your writing sound odd. Today, SEO strategies are much more advanced, and so are search engines. Looking toward 2022 and the years ahead, here are a few things to focus on when it comes to digital marketing: By following these tips, you can get your online presence off to a strong start in 2022. In recent years, local SEO results have become very important. The “local pack” has become a coveted spot for Google search engine results, and searchers know they can search for businesses and services “near me.” So, when someone searches for an “audiologist near me” or “audiologist in [my city],” you want to appear in the top results. Again, we have come a long way from the days of “keyword stuffing.” The aim is no longer to repeat a keyword as often as possible and hope that page would come up when people searched for that keyword online. Now, the goal is to answer the question asked by the searcher. As noted above, the key is to give the searcher what they are looking for. You need to consider who your searchers are (your audience), what they are looking for or asking about, and how you can deliver what they are looking for on your website. As we head into 2022 and beyond, it will become increasingly important to hone in on searcher intent and provide the best answer to their queries. To do well in online search result rankings, you need to provide the best, most relevant answer to the question a searcher asks. You can do this by providing quality content that offers valuable information and seeks to truly provide the answer the searcher needs. Google has been investing heavily in machine learning and artificial intelligence to ensure that their search results answer the question the searcher poses. If you want to do well in online searches in 2022 andmoving forward, make sure you are answering the important questions. If you are not sure where to start, create a list of questions you are frequently asked about your services, products, and qualifications. Answer these questions on your website. Demonstrate that you are an expert in your field. Search engines like Google are expected to continue to place great emphasis on local results. Now, a local search brings up a Google Map with mapped search results, reviews, photos, and more. Customers rely on these types of results to help them find what they are looking for nearby, and that is not going to change. To take advantage of what these potential new patients are looking for, you should focus on your local online presence. 1. Local Focus 2. Answer theQuestion 3. Seek Searcher Intent
